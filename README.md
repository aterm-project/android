## Start here

There is no published consumer installer matching the current main branch. Build from source using the guide. Desktop `ci-input-*` prereleases contain build inputs, not an installer. Do not treat a successful source CI run as a signed Windows/macOS/iOS/Android distribution.

## What is included

- SSH terminals, compact Host lists, groups and reusable commands.
- SFTP/SCP file workspaces, split panes and saved window sets where supported.
- Local encrypted profiles or a self-hosted synchronized Vault.
- Organizations, member sharing and temporary links when enabled by the server.
- Chinese, Japanese, English and Russian UI; blue application accents and customizable terminal colors.

## Quick start

Use macOS and Xcode. A no-codesign build is not an installable signed device release.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aterm-project/ios.git
cd ios/apps/client
flutter doctor -v
flutter pub get --enforce-lockfile
flutter build ios --no-codesign
```

These repositories are currently private; your GitHub account needs access to clone them or download private artifacts. Detailed host prerequisites, output paths and update steps are in the [installation guide](docs/INSTALLATION.en.md).

## Support boundaries

Native Windows RDP requires the bundled engine; Android/iOS do not include that engine. Browser SSH requires an enabled, restricted Relay. Temporary browser SSH/RDP is a separate trusted-gateway flow. Native platform build/device acceptance is separate from the Linux Dart/widget checks in CI.

The full Flutter suite has disclosed historical failures. CI runs its documented focused checks; review the workflow and [validation documentation](docs/README.md) for their scope. Keep server state, account credentials and signing material outside Git.

## Repository layout

`apps/client/` contains the Flutter app; `packages/` contains five local dependency forks; `protocol/` contains shared contracts and test vectors. Only this repository’s platform runners are included.

Third-party licenses and upstream notices remain alongside their dependencies. Current source hashes are recorded in `SOURCE_SNAPSHOT.json`; initial import history is in `SOURCE_PROVENANCE.json`.
